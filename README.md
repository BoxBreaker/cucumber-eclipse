# Cucumber-Eclipse

Eclipse plugin for Cucumber. This repo will host what comes out of the collabortive effort that results from
[this discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/cukes/UzywqbOmqBc/discussion).

Access to this repo will be given to a team of 2-3 people who have been involved in a previous effort to 
create an Eclipse plugin. Just create an issue to request access.
